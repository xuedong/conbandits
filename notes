Sanity check:

- To run just the linear regression to see if LinUCB fits for the problem.
- Features normalization?


Perspectives:

- Changing distributions (adversial ordering of arriving contexts).
- Check some other underlying regression models?
- Check the regret curve.
- Cold start more interesting?
